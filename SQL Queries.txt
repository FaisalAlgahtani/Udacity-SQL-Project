We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The
following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics,
Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and
the number of times it has been rented out.

Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly
movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a
table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter,
second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%,
50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to
also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.  */

 Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles,
and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for
each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three
columns:
• Category
• Rental length category
• Count

We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during
every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store
ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store
has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the
following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that
month.*/
